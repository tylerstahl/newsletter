# LabDAO Newsletter No. 2
Gm! Welcome to the second edition of LabDAO’s monthly newsletter! LabDAO was created just a few months ago, and we have so much going on in the community. By putting things in one place, we hope it will be easier to keep up with all of LabDAO’s moving parts. You can expect updates on LabDAO community news, events, and new developments in the ecosystem. As always, we welcome any feedback, comments, or suggestions!

## What is LabDAO?
LabDAO is a decentralized organization made up of individuals from across the world working to accelerate life science innovation and collaboration. We are building an open-source and community-owned protocol where users can exchange research services, and find collaborators.
