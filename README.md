# Newsletter
This is the repository we use to keep track of all newsletters written and distributed within the LabDAO community. Using git to manage writing and editing processes might not be the most natural choice for most folks, so let's go through why we think this is a good tool and how to get the most out of using it. 

## Newsletter process (repeated monthly)
1. source activities within the DAO for the current month by scanning discord channels, especially #general, #technology-stewardship and #growth. Collect these bullet points in an issue on this repository called YYYYMM (e.g. 202203)
2. check in with the #technology-stewardship and # growth chat on up to 5 items that should be highlighted and add them to the issue thread on github.
3. craft the activities into a succinct text that is called YYYYMM.md (e.g. 202203.md). You can use the last newsletter that was published as a template. For fast synchronous collaborative writing we recommend hackmd.io. For asychronous writing we recommend using the build-in editor within github that is accessible by hitting "." on your keyboard.
4. ideally one week before the end of the preceding month post a "request for comments" into the general chat and link them to the newsletter issue you created in step 1.
5. after sign-off by a core member, publish the article on revue and draft a tweet for @lab_dao. Non-core members need to work with core members for this step as they have access to these credentials.

## Technology
* distribution via Revue
* announcements via Twitter

## Team (alphabetical order)

## Financials (request for comments)
* the production of a newsletter issue is rewarded with 500 USDC which includes writing, editing, illustration and distribution. The bounty is distributed among the newsletter team according to an internal mechanism. 
* Mechanisms to swap USDC for LAB tokens will exist.

## FAQ
### Why do we use git to write?
Git is a version control system designed to facilitate collaboration between software develops. It is the best tool to enable a large group of contributors to agree on a shared truth and contribute in a decentralized way. Software developers communicate with computers using code - Writers communicate with humans using natural language. In a decentralized community, like LabDAO, keeping track of activities publicly ensures maximum inclusivity. We want everybody to be able to contribute in the writing process and open pull requests with changes. Even though there will most likely always be a team focused on the task of writing a newsletter, doing it out in the open with everybody able to suggest structured improvements is important. Instead of hiring members, like in a traditional company, we simply onboard organic contributors.

### How do we use git to write?
Git can be a bit finicky. The easiest work with it is to go to the labdao/newsletter repository in your browser and press the "." button. This will open an IDE where you can edit the article and commit your changes. If you and others want to work on the repository at the same time, the best way to do this is to use hackmd.io, a collaborative markdown editor that feels like github and google docs had a baby. You can save your results on hackmd.io and push your changes to Github.
